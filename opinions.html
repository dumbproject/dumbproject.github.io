  these are opinions that i have
  <br><br><br>
  i think healthcare should be free
  <br>
  i think UBI (universal basic income) should be a thing, especially as andrew yang envisioned
  <br><br>
  i think the argument for the second amendment of guns being a method to revolt against the government is massively outdated and no longer accurate
  <br>
  i also think guns are as safe as drugs i.e. midnight gospel ep 1 tiny president closing words, there's no such thing as a bad drug, it's all about intent and the user
