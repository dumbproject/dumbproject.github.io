      <!-- i think
      <ul>
        <li>healthcare should be free
        <li>the prison-industrial complex and the military-industrial complex should be entirely ripped apart and deleted
        <li>housing, food, and water should be free
        <li>
        <li>universal basic income should exist
          <ul>
            <li>and come from taxing amazon and other companies that find loopholes to pay $0 in taxes and continue to acquire mass wealth
            <li>this is why i think andrew yang is cool
            <li>currently, everyone has to pay taxes; just give a basic standard minimum to survive back to everyone and it allows the lower class and homeless massive benefits to life and returns to the economy and society from everyone.
            <li>we have the means
            <li>you don't have to fuck people over to survive
            <li>
          </ul>

        <li>bernie won the popular vote twice in the democratic primaries and did not receive candidacy. democrats are corrupt centrists lining the pockets of corporate greed
        <li>
        <li>
        <li>everyone should learn how to play an instrument
        <li>
        <li>
        <li>
        <li>
        <li>guns are an underpowered method to revolt against an overpowered government, so it's a dumb outdated argument for the right to bear arms.
        <li>guns are stupid monkey boomstick explosion tools, mental illness and crime and accidents are dangerous.
